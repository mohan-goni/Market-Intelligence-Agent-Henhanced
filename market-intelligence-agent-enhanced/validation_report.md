## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **PDF Processing**: Complex PDFs with tables and images may not be processed optimally. The system extracts text but may lose formatting.

2. **Audio/Video Processing**: Currently limited to metadata extraction. Full transcription would require additional services.

3. **API Rate Limits**: External APIs have rate limits that may affect performance during heavy usage.

4. **Vector Database Size**: The in-memory vector database has limitations on total storage capacity. A production deployment would need a more robust solution.

5. **Authentication System**: The authentication system is simplified for demonstration purposes and would need enhancement for production use.

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced PDF Processing**: Implement more advanced PDF parsing to handle complex layouts and extract tables.

2. **Audio/Video Transcription**: Integrate with transcription services to extract content from audio and video files.

3. **Database Persistence**: Replace in-memory storage with a persistent database solution for analysis results and user data.

4. **Caching Layer**: Implement caching for API responses to reduce external API calls and improve performance.

5. **User Preferences**: Add user preference settings to customize analysis parameters and display options.

6. **Export Functionality**: Add options to export analysis results in various formats (PDF, Excel, etc.).

7. **Advanced Visualization**: Implement data visualization components for market trends and competitor analysis.

## Conclusion

The enhanced Market Intelligence Agent successfully integrates all requested features and provides a comprehensive solution for market intelligence analysis. The application effectively combines user-uploaded data with information from external APIs to generate insights and answer user queries.

The RAG system provides context-aware responses with source citations, and the chat interfaces allow users to explore specific aspects of the analysis in more detail. The file upload system supports a wide range of file types, making it versatile for different use cases.

While there are some limitations and areas for future improvement, the current implementation meets all the specified requirements and provides a solid foundation for further development.
